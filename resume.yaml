  summary: >-
    Developing websites since 1995, I’ve used JavaScript since its inception and have worked on front-end, back-end, desktop, mobile, and the DevOps side of things.
    I tend to find improvements to the experience of both users and developers and ways of optimising processes within the code and my work environment. I’m passionate about open communication and cooperating as a team.

    I’m originally from **Copenhagen, Denmark**, but I’m currently in **Greece**. Here, my **dockerised NAS** is slowly taking over my other computers, and I wish I had more **Raspberry PIs**.
    When I’m not in front of my main computer, I feed my growing **film collection** (don’t get me started on trivia), fiddle with my good ol’ **Commodore Amiga** (also don’t get me started on trivia), make a bit of **music**, or plan **costumes** for the next Halloween.
